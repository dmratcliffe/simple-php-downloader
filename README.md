# simple-php-downloader
A self hosted website which allows downloading files from your webserver

# the risks involved
by installing this script on a public webserver all of your files only become as safe as your password.
You should make sure it's strong or you only expose this file when you need to download files from your server.

# the reason this exists
I needed something to quickly download folder while useing code-server.
By default code-server lets you download individual files but this didn't work so well for larger files.
Looking around most file managers require a lot of backend or don't have folder downloading for some reason.

This aims to fill the hole of downloading files and folders from a website, nothing more. (No uploading ect.)

# setup
TODO after the script is written lmao
